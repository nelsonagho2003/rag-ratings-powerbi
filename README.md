# RAG Ratings & KPI Dashboard â€“ Apprenticeship Insights

This project is a Power BI dashboard that provides a detailed overview of **RAG ratings** (Red, Amber, Green) across work-based tutors and apprenticeship standards.

Due to company policy, I have replaced the original SQL Server data source with an equivalent **Excel file**. This ensures the project remains shareable while still demonstrating the same logic, structure, and insight you'd find in the live environment.

## ðŸ“Š What the Dashboard Shows

- Breakdown of **RAG rating counts** for each work-based tutor
- Monthly **KPI comparisons** for Red, Amber, and Green ratings
- Insight into which apprenticeship standards may need more attention
- Trends over time and key performance shifts

## âœ… Why It Matters

This solution was built to be both **intuitive and user-friendly**, ensuring that **technical and non-technical stakeholders** alike can draw meaningful insights at a glance.

Itâ€™s designed to support better decision-making and resource allocation within the apprenticeship program, with a focus on **clarity**, **accessibility**, and **actionable metrics**.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- **Power BI** for data visualization and dashboard creation
- **SQL Server** (data originally stored here)
- **Excel** (used in this version to replicate the SQL data structure)
